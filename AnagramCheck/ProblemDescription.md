# Anagram Check

Given two strings, check if they’re anagrams or not.

Two strings are anagrams if they are written using the same exact letters, ignoring space, punctuation and capitalization.

Each letter should have the same count in both strings.

For example, ‘Eleven plus two’ and ‘Twelve plus one’ are meaningful anagrams of each other.
